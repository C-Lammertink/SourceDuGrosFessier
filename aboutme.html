  <h2>The Battle of Culloden, April 16 1746</h2>
  <p>
    The battle lasted less than an hour. <br>
  The Jacobites had already lost a significant amount of men to desertion and death before the battle began. 
  They started the battle with only 5000 hungry and exhausted troops, who had to fight against 7000 to 9000 well-rested, well-equipped, and well-supplied men. 
  Likely between 1500 and 2000 Jacobites were killed or wounded, whereas on the English government’s side, these numbers were only estimated to be around 300. 
  After the battle, wounded Jacobite were killed where they lay and stayed unburied. Others were stripped and left to die. Charles escaped to France. 
 <br>
  <br>
    In the weeks after, Government forces searched for rebels, confiscated cattle and burned settlements. 
  Men were killed for wearing Highland dress (tartan and kilts), women were raped and killed and children were slaughtered. The leader of the government forces, the Duke of Cumberland, was nicknamed Butcher Cumberland. 
  The clan system (from Gaelic clann, ‘family/children’) was dismantled and Highland dress was outlawed. 
 <br>
 <br>
    Culloden still bears signs of the massacre that took place there: <br>
  ‘’The clan stones were large boulders of gray granite, rounded by weather and blotched with lichens. They sat on patches of smooth grass, widely scattered near the edge of the moor. 
  Each one bore a single name, the carving so faded by weather as to be nearly illegible in some cases.
